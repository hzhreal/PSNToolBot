# PSNToolBot
Discord bot used to mainly add PlayStation 3 avatars to shopping cart, and obtain PlayStation account id from username.

# Tutorial

## NPSSO
For the bot to completely function you need to input your NPSSO 64 character token. This is so you can be authorized to use the PSN API to obtain account ID from username. Make sure to read more about it [here](https://github.com/isFakeAccount/psnawp/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) where you can find out how to obtain it.  

## Usage
- Cd into the directory and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- Run bot.py

Enjoy!
